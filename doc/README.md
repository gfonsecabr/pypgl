Pangolin (or pgl) is a header-only C++ library for computational geometry algorithms in the plane. It is intended to be easy to use and efficient.

The `Point` and `Segment` classes are two of [several shapes](shapes.md).

The coordinates are of type `int` by default, but [other types](types.md) including rational and floating point numbers may be used instead.

All shapes support [many predicates](shape_methods.md#predicates) and several other [methods and operators](shape_methods.md). Fundamental [algorithms](algorithms.md) and [data structures](data_structures.md) are also provided.

A `Canvas` class is provided for [easy visualization](canvas.md).

As a header-only library with no dependency, you can compile your code directly with `g++` or `clang++` (the standard needs to be at least c++20):

```bash
g++ -std=c++23 -Iinclude/ -o example1 examples/example1.cpp
clang++ -std=c++23 -Iinclude/ -o example1 examples/example1.cpp
```
